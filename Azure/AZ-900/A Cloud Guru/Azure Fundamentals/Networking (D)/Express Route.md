_Creation Date:_ `=this.file.cday`

Express Route provides a high-speed, private connection directly to Azure. It is especially useful when:

- Hosting data on an on-premises network,
- High availability is required,
- Frequent large-scale or regular data migrations occur.

This service does not use the public internet, ensuring privacy and security.
