> _Creation Date:_ `=this.file.cday` _Last Modified:_ `=this.file.mday`

Azure App Service is a PaaS solution from Azure, offering a platform to craft, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps.
- Think Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, etc. 
## Key Points

- Provides a **fully managed environment**, offloading infrastructure complexities such as server, network, and storage management.
- **Multilingual support**: .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and Python.
- **Dynamic scalability** allows auto-scaling and load balancing based on demand.
- App service can reduce the management overhead (like elastic beanstalk)
- Reduces the requirements for you to manage infra and servers
- Deploy code, Azure handles the rest
- Highly customized applications may not work well
- Very good for developers, but non developers might have a problem

### Categories

- **Web Apps**: Design and host websites. Compatible with multiple programming languages and can run in both Windows and Linux environments.
- **Web Apps for Containers**: Facilitates hosting applications in containers. Ensures consistent dependencies and environment fidelity.
