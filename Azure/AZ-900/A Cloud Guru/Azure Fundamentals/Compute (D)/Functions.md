# Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service enabling the execution of small code units (or "functions") without the overhead of infrastructure management. It complements Azure's IaaS and PaaS offerings.

## Key Points

- Represents a step forward in cloud computing, abstracting more than IaaS or PaaS.
- Azure Functions operate in a managed setting, without access to the base OS.
- Can range from singular functions to aggregated tasks.
- Triggered via URLs, Azure Storage data modifications, or Azure Queue messages.
- Being ephemeral, functions run per trigger, optimizing costs by charging only for utilized compute time.
- Supports languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python.

Azure Functions lets developers concentrate on functionality, omitting infrastructure concerns, making it ideal for microservices, system integrations, real-time processing, and automated workflows.
