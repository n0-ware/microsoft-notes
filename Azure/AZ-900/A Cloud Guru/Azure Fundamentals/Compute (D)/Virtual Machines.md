Azure Virtual Machines (VM) provide persistent cloud-based VMs as part of Azure's IaaS offering.

## Key Points

- Azure VMs combine the flexibility of a dedicated server with cloud scalability and convenience.
- Offers diverse machine types for different needs, from compute to storage to GPU-intensive tasks.
- Allows global deployment and management of applications, while retaining control over network configurations, host OS, and VM software.
- VM Scale Sets enable easy creation and management of uniform VM groups for high availability.
- VMs in an Availability Set ensure continuous application function even if a VM becomes unavailable.
