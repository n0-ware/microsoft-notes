# Cloud Arhicture Models

- Public vs Private

## Private

- It is yours, but does replace some of the opex savings with capex
- It is yours, entirely

## Public

- Azure is this, we use someone elses stuff, but we are separate

## Hybrid

- Combines the on-prem/private models with a public model
- Keep your sensitive items on prem or in a private cloud, but trade some capex for the option of using a public cloud
