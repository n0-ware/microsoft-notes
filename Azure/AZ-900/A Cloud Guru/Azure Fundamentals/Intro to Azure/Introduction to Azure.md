## Core Concepts

- Fault Tolerance
- High-Availability
- Scalability
- Elasticity

### What is the Cloud

- Cloud = using someone else's computing resources in a remote data center around the world

### Benefits and Differences

- **Fault Tolerance**
- **High-Availability**

Primarily, the docs and data don't live on your stuff. You offload the responsibility of storage to someone else and your own devices going down does not kill your data

The availability of being in the cloud enables global access (limitations of course). Mobile, desktop, apps, etc. All can access the data

### Business Use-Cases

- **Scalability**
- **Elasticity**

A business does not have to accurately project cost nearly as much and failures to forecast don't result in downtime (generally). The cloud is highly scalable on-demand and can respond to capacity needs at nearly a minute-to-minute base. 

## Azure Organization and Infrastructure

- What is it? 
- Global infrasturcture
- Azure Services
- Resource Hierarchy and Organization
- Identify and Access Management
- Monitoring Azure
