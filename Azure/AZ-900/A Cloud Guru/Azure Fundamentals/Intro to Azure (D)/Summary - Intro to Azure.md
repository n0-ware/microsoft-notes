## Business Agility

- Organization's rapid adaptability to market/environment changes.
- Focus on time to value, innovation, low latency, economic effectiveness, rapid adaptation, and flexibility.

## Cloud Architecture Models

- **Private Cloud**: Entirely owned, potential shift from OpEx to CapEx.
- **Public Cloud**: Azure's model, shared resources with isolated user spaces.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Integration of on-premises/private models with public offerings.

## Identity and Access Management

- Questions: Who are the users? What can they do? On which resources?
- **Azure AD**: Determines the "who".
- **Azure RBAC**: Defines permissions or "what actions".
- **Scope**: Establishes accessible resources or the "where".

## Monitoring Azure

- Azure Monitor captures metrics and logs from Azure and some non-Azure sources.
- Logs record event details; Metrics track performance.
- Monitoring categories: Insights, Visualization, Analysis, Response, Integration.

## Regions and Availability Zones

- **Regions**: Latency-defined perimeters, housing multiple availability zones.
- **Availability Zones**: Unique physical locations within regions, usually containing multiple independent data centers.

## Service Models

- **IaaS**: Basic infrastructure services.
- **PaaS**: Extension of IaaS with middleware and database management.
- **SaaS**: End-user applications.
- **Serverless**: Event-driven solutions without direct infrastructure management.

## Marketplace

- Offers free and paid services.
- Certified solutions for reduced maintenance.
- Efficient adoption of pre-built solutions for quick market entry.

Remember the shared responsibility model and the distinctions between various service models to make the most of Azure's capabilities.
