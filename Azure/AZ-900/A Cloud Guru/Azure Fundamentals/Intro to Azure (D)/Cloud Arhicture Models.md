# Cloud Architecture Models

> _Creation Date:_ `=this.file.cday` _Last Modified:_ `=this.file.mday`

There are three primary cloud models:

## Private Cloud

- Entirely proprietary, potentially offsetting some OpEx benefits with CapEx costs.

## Public Cloud

- Azure exemplifies this: utilizing external resources but retaining isolation.

## Hybrid Cloud

- A blend of on-premises/private models with the public model. Retains sensitive assets on-premises or in a private cloud while leveraging the advantages of a public cloud.
