# Service Models

> _Creation Date:_ `=this.file.cday` _Last Modified:_ `=this.file.mday`

Azure operates on various service models:

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: The foundational layer, providing basic infrastructure services.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: An extension of IaaS, including middleware and database management capabilities.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: The most comprehensive service layer, typically end-user applications.
- **Serverless**: Either an extension or subset of the above models, focusing on event-driven solutions without managing infrastructure.

It's vital to remember the shared responsibility model, dictating which components are managed by the cloud provider and which by the user.
