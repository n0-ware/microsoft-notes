## Defining the Cloud

The cloud symbolizes the use of remote data center resources located globally, owned and operated by third parties.

## Benefits & Implications

Cloud adoption offers:

- Data and applications no longer strictly reside on personal devices, reducing data loss risks.
- Global accessibility, with a range of devices like mobiles, desktops, and apps being able to tap into cloud-stored data.

## Business Justifications

The cloud's adaptability supports:

- **Scalability**: Businesses can dynamically adjust to demand without excessive downtime.
- **Elasticity**: Immediate response to capacity requirements, aligning costs with actual needs.
