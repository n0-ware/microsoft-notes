Azure Archive offers very low-cost, long-term storage solutions. It's designed for data that is infrequently accessed and that regulatory requirements mandate to be retained for a long time.

1. Archive storage is the most affordable option available.
2. Durable and encrypted for infrequent data access.
3. The storage tier can be upgraded to premium as needed.
4. Provides a high level of security, making it suitable even for sensitive data such as medical records.

**Note:** Azure Archive is a **blob** storage type.
