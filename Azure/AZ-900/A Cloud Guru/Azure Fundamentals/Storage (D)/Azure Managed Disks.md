> _Creation Date:_ `=this.file.cday` _Last Modified:_ `=this.file.mday`

Managed Disks are used with Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). Azure handles the management of these disks, ensuring a guaranteed size and performance as per the service-level agreement.

## Types of Managed Disks

1. **HDD**: Standard hard disk drives offering low-cost storage.
2. **Standard SSD**: These solid-state drives offer high reliability, stability, and low latency.
3. **Premium SSD**: Ideal for applications that need very low latency.
4. **Ultra Disk**: Suited for data-intensive workloads that require sub-millisecond latency and up to 64TB of storage, such as gaming, analytics, data lakes, etc.
