# Defense in Depth

> _Creation Date:_ `=this.file.cday` _Last Modified:_ `=this.file.mday`

Azure employs a Defense in Depth (DiD) strategy which is similar to an on-premise approach with physical hardware. The layers include:

1. **Physical Security**
2. **Identity and Access**
3. **Perimeter**
4. **Network**
5. **Compute**
6. **Gateways and Firewalls**
7. **Data**

Each layer contributes to overall system security, providing a comprehensive defense against potential threats.
