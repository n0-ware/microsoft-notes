Azure Sentinel is a centralized SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system for Azure.

The workflow of Sentinel is as follows:

1. Data collection.
2. Aggregation and normalization.
3. Threat detection through data analysis.
4. The application of machine learning and AI for advanced insights.
5. Action taken based on analysis.

Azure Sentinel handles steps 1-4, leaving you to take action based on its insights.

Key features include:

- Behavioral Analytics for detecting anomalous patterns.
- Integration with AWS for multi-cloud scenarios.
- Scalability at the cloud level, ensuring fast and efficient operation.
