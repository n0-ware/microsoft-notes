# Pricing

- Capital expenditure, or CapEx, is money spent by the entity on acquiring or maintaining their fixed assets such as land, buildings and equipment
- Operational expenditure, or OpEx, is the ongoing cost for running a product or project, your business system, and the day-to-day or annual costs that eat away at your business


## Pricing Models

Hourly vs Consumption

- Pay per edecution
- Per second
- Combination of the two

Consumption-based pricing means low usage = low cost with no locked in fees and avoids capex in favor of opex
