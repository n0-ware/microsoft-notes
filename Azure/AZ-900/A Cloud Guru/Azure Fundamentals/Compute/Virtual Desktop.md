# Virtual Desktop
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`
> *Last Modified:* `=this.file.mday`

- Any virtual machine type or size to run the VM except Linux (naturally)
- Shared workspaces accessible from anywhere

## Benefits

- Reuse Windows 10 licenses to reduce cost
- Concurrency in that multiple users can use the same instance at the same time
- Accessible from anywhere with Windows 10 or 11. And a Windows browser.
- Secure data using Azure Storage instead of on a different location.
