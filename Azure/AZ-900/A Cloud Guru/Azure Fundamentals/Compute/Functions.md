## Functions vs IaaS or PaaS

- Using Infrastructure or Platform as a Service
	- Allows access to the operating system
	- Provides resource visibility
	- Apps and services have no OS access, but the resource has access.
- Functions differ greatly in that
	- They are the smallest compute service on Azure
	- They can be as small as single functions or multiple grouped functions or batches
	- They are called or invoked via the standard web address URL
	- Run once and then stop, ensuring you only pay for what you use.
