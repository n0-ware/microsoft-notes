Azure provides a suite of monitoring tools that work collectively to provide detailed insights into the performance and health of your Azure resources.
## Log Analytics

Azure Monitor generates a large volume of logs, and Log Analytics serves as the storage and analysis platform for these logs.

- It provides an interface to store, analyze, and monitor logs, such as VM details, disk sizes, VPN connections, etc.
- Enables long-term analysis and complex querying of various metrics.
- Supports pre-built queries and allows for the creation of custom queries.
- Uses the **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** for querying and manipulating data.
