Privacy is a critical component of cloud services, integrated across multiple facets of Azure.

## Overview

- Privacy is not confined to a single service or location within Azure, but is a crucial element throughout all Azure services.
- Azure implements privacy considerations through a variety of features and tools, including:
    - [Information Protection](Information Protection)
    - [Azure Policy](Governance#Azure Policy)
    - [Cloud Adoption Framework](Governance#Cloud Adoption Framework) guides
    - [Compliance Manager](Compliance#Azure Compliance Manager)
- Familiarize yourself with Microsoft's Privacy Statement, as understanding it is important for the Azure certification exam. The privacy statement provides basic information on how Microsoft collects and uses data.
