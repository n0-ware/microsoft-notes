> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`

## The Basics

- Azure AD functions like an org chart, phone book, all in one access list in a single service.
- Active Directory as a central feature allows Microsoft shops to focus on core product development instead of the granularity required to manage users without it
- Automatic provisioning allows developers of applications and infrastructure to shift focus away from the time consuming task
- It also affords a single source of truth for all of your business applications.
- SSO and unified passwords are key for user quality of life and security of the enterprise
