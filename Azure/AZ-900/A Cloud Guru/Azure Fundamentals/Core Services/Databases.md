## What is a database?

> Specifically speaking to managed services here. 
**Structured Data**

Such as...
- User directory
- Transaction records
- Catalogs

- like a WS. Azure has pretty much all the storage capabilities that you'll need
- They have SQL and Nosql
- Fully managed and provisioned infra
- single versus multiple region
- Open source and proprietary.
