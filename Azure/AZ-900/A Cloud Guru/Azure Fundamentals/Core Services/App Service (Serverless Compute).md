# App Service

- App service can reduce the management overhead (like elastic beanstalk)
- Reduces the requirements for you to manage infra and servers

- Think Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, etc. 
- Deploy code, Azure handles the rest
- Highly customized applications may not work well
- Very good for developers, but non devs might have a problem
