# ARM Templates
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`

> ARM templates are Azure's native Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) solution that can consistently and automatically deploy the same environments that are defined in code format.

Arm Templates Available here - [Browse code samples | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/browse/?expanded=azure&products=azure-resource-manager)

- Repeat common tasks with automation
- Functions like infrastructure as code

Benefits are
- Idempotent (run the same every time)
- Source control via control of templates
- Can be reused
- Declarative (specify what you want **not** how it is done)
- No human errors
