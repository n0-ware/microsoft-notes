# Manageability

> _Creation Date:_ `=this.file.cday` _Last Modified:_ `=this.file.mday`

> Manageability has two aspects: 1. How you create and manage resources, which includes autoscaling, template-based deployments, and monitoring/alerts. 2. How you interact with your cloud environments, including via the web portal, command line, and programmatic APIs.

Manageability in the cloud can be segmented into two main aspects:

- **Management OF the Cloud**: Features like auto-scaling, monitoring, and deployment using ARM templates fall here.
- **Management IN the Cloud**: Tools like the portal, CLI, and APIs that aid in efficient management within the cloud.
