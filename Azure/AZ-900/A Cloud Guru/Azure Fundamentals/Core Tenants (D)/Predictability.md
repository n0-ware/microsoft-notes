> Predictability is knowing that your application will perform at a consistent level. This is achieved through a combination of autoscaling, high availability, and load balancing. While there is some overlap with the concepts of scalability and high availability to achieve this outcome, the concept of being confident of _consistent_ performance is Predictability.

- Helps in maintaining cost predictability, preventing unforeseen expenditure spikes.
- Real-time tracking and forecasting of resource usage facilitates more accurate future predictions, leading to better cost management.
- Transparency in costs
