> Think about [security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/security/) throughout the entire lifecycle of an application, from design and implementation to deployment and operations. The Azure platform provides protections against various threats, such as network intrusion and DDoS attacks. You still need to build security into your application and into your DevOps processes.

- Were there relying on managed services or managing them yourself, The cloud provides robust security measures
- Managed services rely on the owner of the infrastructure to handle most of the patching and security and availability and other tenants of the cloud
- Managing your own allows for more flexibility, but does increase the management cost.
