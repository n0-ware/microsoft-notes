# Pricing

> When you design a cloud solution, focus on generating incremental value early. Apply the principles of _Build-Measure-Learn_ to accelerate your time to market while avoiding capital-intensive solutions. See [What is the build-measure-learn feedback loop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/considerations/adoption#what-is-the-build-measure-learn-feedback-loop).

Pricing in the cloud can be understood through the following terms:

- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: Spending on acquiring/maintaining fixed assets like land, buildings, and equipment.
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: Ongoing costs for running a business system or product.

## Pricing Models

- **Hourly vs Consumption**: Payment models can be per execution, per second, or a combination.
- **Consumption-Based**: Low usage translates to low costs, favoring OpEx over CapEx.
