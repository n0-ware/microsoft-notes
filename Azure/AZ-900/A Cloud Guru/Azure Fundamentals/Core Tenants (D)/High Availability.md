# High Availability

> _Creation Date:_ `=this.file.cday` _Last Modified:_ `=this.file.mday`

## Overview
>High Availability ensures continuous operation at acceptable performance levels, even during unexpected demand surges. It's a fundamental aspect of many cloud concepts.

> While there is some overlap between many of the core cloud concepts, high availability is specifically defined by making sure resources are alwaysÂ _available_, which is carried out by using clusters of identical servers, automatically replacing failed servers, etc.

- **Redundancies are Crucial**:
    - **Data Centers**: Including power, cooling, and networking.
    - **Availability Zone (AZ) Redundancies**.
    - **Regional Redundancies**.
    - **Resource Clustering**: e.g., virtual machines.

```ad-tip
Reliability focuses on uptime and failure-tolerance. In contrast, High Availability emphasizes responsiveness to customer demand and accessibility.
