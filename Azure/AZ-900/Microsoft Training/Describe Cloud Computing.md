## Types of Cloud

- Public, Hybrid, Private

**Exam asks to compare and contrast**

- Primary difference is I can just go sign up for AWS/Azure and there are no "real" barriers. Private meaning there is some level of exclusivity and I likely had to jump through non-trivial hoops to stand-up and continue maintaining my cloud, with additional costs

## Cloud Pricing

- Controversial?
	- Complicated, to some
	- Difficult to project accurately if you are actively using/iterating
	- Takes time to baseline
	- General pricing model like aws
- **Most common method is time/use/data/calls/messages**
	- Generally very cheap for everything, particularly "events" like calls/queries
- **Generally charged by the minute/GB/call**
- **Inbound traffic free, outbound traffic charged**
